      <p>Designing networked systems that take best advantage of heterogeneous dataplanes – e.g., dividing packet processing across both a PISA switch and an x86 CPUs – can improve performance, efficiency, and resource consumption. However, programming for multiple hardware targets remains challenging because developers must learn platform-specific languages and skills. While some ‘write-once, run-anywhere’ compilers exist, they are unable to consider a range of implementation options to tune the NF to meet performance objectives. In this short paper, we explore preliminary ideas towards a compiler that explores a large search space of different mappings of functionality to hardware. This exploration can be tuned for a programmer-specified objective, such as minimizing memory consumption or maximizing network throughput. Our initial prototype, SyNAPSE, is based on a methodology called component-based synthesis and supports deployments across x86 and Tofino platforms. Relative to a baseline compiler which only generates one deployment decision, SyNAPSE uncovers thousands of deployment options – including a deployment which reduces the amount of controller traffic by an order of magnitude, and another deployment which halves memory usage.</p>

	   Sketching algorithms or sketches enable accurate network measurement results with low resource footprints. While emerging programmable switches are an attractive target to get these benefits, current implementations of sketches are either inefficient and/or infeasible on hardware. Our contributions in the paper are: (1) systematically analyzing the resource bottlenecks of existing sketch implementations in hardware; (2) identifying practical and correct-by-construction optimization techniques to tackle the identified bottlenecks; and (3) designing an easy-to-use library called SketchLib to help developers efficiently implement their sketch algorithms in switch hardware to benefit from these resource optimizations. Our evaluation on state-of-the-art sketches demonstrates that SketchLib reduces the hardware resource footprint up to 96% without impacting fidelity.

      <p>We design and evaluate SwiSh, a distributed shared state management layer for data-plane P4 programs. SwiSh enables running scalable stateful distributed network functions on programmable switches entirely in the data-plane. We explore several schemes to build a shared variable abstraction, which differ in consistency, performance, and in-switch implementation complexity. We introduce the novel Strong Delayed-Writes (SDW) protocol which offers consistent snapshots of shared data-plane objects with semantics known as rr-relaxed strong linearizability, enabling implementation of distributed concurrent sketches with precise error bounds.

We implement strong, eventual, and SDW consistency protocols in Tofino switches, and compare their performance in microbenchmarks and three realistic network functions, NAT, DDoS detector, and rate limiter. Our results show that the distributed state management in the data plane is practical, and outperforms centralized solutions by up to four orders of magnitude in update throughput and replication latency.

      <p>Recent advances in programmable networking hardware technology such as programmable switches and smart network interface cards create a new computing paradigm called in-network computing. This new paradigm allows functionality that has been served by servers or proprietary hardware devices, ranging from network middleboxes to components of distributed systems, to now be performed in the network. The demand for higher performance and the commercial availability of programmable hardware have driven the popularity of in-network computing. <br />

While many recent efforts have demonstrated the performance benefit of in-network computing, we observe a significant gap between what it offers today and evolving application demands. In particular, we argue that in-network computing lacks resource elasticity and fault resiliency which are essential building blocks for practical computing platforms, limiting its potential. Elasticity can address the shortcoming that today’s in-network computing only supports a simple deployment model where a single application runs on a single device equipped with fixed and limited resources. Similarly, fault resiliency is critical for managing prevalent device failures for the correctness and performance of applications, but it has gained littleattention. Although resource elasticity and fault resiliency have been extensively studied for traditional CPU server-based computing, we find that enabling them on programmable networking devices is challenging, especially due to their low-level abstractions, hardware constraints, heterogeneity, and workload characteristics.
<br />
In this thesis, we argue that by designing high-level abstractions and runtime environments that help leverage compute and memory resources available outside of one type of device, we can make in-network computing more elastic and resilient without any hardware modifications. This concept, which we call device resource augmentation, is a key enabler for resource elasticity and fault resiliency for stateful in-network applications written for programmable switches. In particular, we design three systems, named TEA, ExoPlane, and RedPlane, that use this concept to support elastic memory and elastic compute/memory, and fault resiliency, respectively. Each of these systems consists of a key abstraction, programming APIs, and a runtime environment. We demonstrate their feasibility and effectiveness with prototype implementations and evaluations using various in-network applications. Putting all the pieces together, developers can easily enable resource elasticity and fault resiliency for their applications without worrying about underlying complexities.</p>

Many recent efforts have demonstrated the performance benefits of running
datacenter functions (<i>e.g.,</i> NATs, load balancers, monitoring)
on programmable switches. However, a key missing piece remains: fault tolerance.
This is especially critical as the network is no longer stateless and pure
endpoint recovery does not suffice. In this paper, we design and implement RedPlane,
a fault-tolerant state store for stateful in-switch applications.  This provides
in-switch applications consistent access to their state, even if the switch they
run on fails or traffic is rerouted to an alternative switch. We address key
challenges in devising a practical, provably correct replication protocol and
implementing it in the switch data plane. Our evaluations show that RedPlane incurs
negligible overhead and enables end-to-end applications to rapidly recover from
switch failures.

	  Sketching algorithms or sketches are attractive as telemetry
capabilities on programmable hardware switches since they
offer rigorous accuracy guarantees and use compact data
structures. However, we find that in practice, their actual
implementations can have a significant (up to 94x) accuracy
drop compared to theoretical expectations. We find that the
delays incurred by pulling and resetting the data plane state
induce accuracy degradation. We design and implement solutions to reduce the delays and show that our solutions can
help eliminate almost all the inaccuracy of existing sketch
workflows.

   Programmable switches have been touted as an attractive alternative for
   deploying network functions (NFs) such as network address translators (NATs),
   load balancers, and firewalls. However, their limited memory capacity has
   been a major stumbling block that has stymied their adoption for supporting
   state-intensive NFs such as cloud-scale NATs and load balancers that maintain
   millions of flow-table entries. In this paper, we explore a new approach that
   leverages DRAM on servers available in typical NFV clusters. Our new system
   architecture, called TEA (Table Extension Architecture), provides a virtual
   table abstraction that allows NFs on programmable switches to look up large
   virtual tables built on external DRAM. Our approach enables switch ASICs to
   access external DRAM purely in the data plane without involving CPUs on
   servers. We address key design and implementation challenges in realizing
   this idea. We demonstrate its feasibility and practicality with our
   implementation on a Tofino-based programmable switch. Our evaluation shows
   that NFs built with TEA can look up table entries on external DRAM with low
   and predictable latency (1.8-2.2 μs) and the lookup throughput can be
   linearly scaled with additional servers (138 million lookups per seconds with
   8 servers).

   Reconfigurable datacenter networks (RDCNs) augment traditional packet
   switches with high-bandwidth reconfigurable circuits. In these networks,
   high-bandwidth circuits are assigned to particular source-destination rack
   pairs based on a schedule. To make efficient use of RDCNs, active TCP flows
   between such pairs must quickly ramp up their sending rates when
   high-bandwidth circuits are made available. Past studies have shown that TCP
   performs well on RDCNs with millisecond-scale reconfiguration delays, during
   which time the circuit network is offline. However, modern RDCNs can
   reconfigure in as little as 20 μs, and maintain a particular
   configuration for fewer than 10 RTTs. We show that existing TCP variants
   cannot ramp up quickly enough to work well on these modern RDCNs. We identify
   two methods to address this issue: First, an in-network solution that
   dynamically resizes top-of-rack switch virtual output queues to prebuffer
   packets; Second, an endpoint-based solution that increases the congestion
   window, cwnd, based on explicit circuit state feedback sent via the ECN-echo
   bit. To evaluate these techniques, we build an open-source RDCN emulator,
   Etalon, and show that a combination of dynamic queue resizing and explicit
   circuit state feedback increases circuit utilization by 1.91x with an
   only 1.20x increase in tail latency.

   Many popular large-scale cloud applications are increasingly using
   containerization for high resource efficiency and lightweight isolation. In
   parallel, many data-intensive applications (e.g., data analytics and deep
   learning frameworks) are adopting or looking to adopt RDMA for high
   networking performance. Industry trends suggest that these two approaches are
   on an inevitable collision course. In this paper, we present FreeFlow, a
   software-based RDMA virtualization framework designed for containerized
   clouds. FreeFlow realizes virtual RDMA networking purely with a
   software-based approach using commodity RDMA NICs. Unlike existing RDMA
   virtualization solutions, FreeFlow fully satisfies the requirements from
   cloud environments, such as isolation for multi-tenancy, portability for
   container migrations, and controllability for control and data plane
   policies. FreeFlow is also transparent to applications and provides
   networking performance close to bare-metal RDMA with low CPU overhead. In our
   evaluations with TensorFlow and Spark, FreeFlow provides almost the same
   application performance as bare-metal RDMA.

   Network switches are an attractive vantage point to serve various network
   applications and functions such as load balancing and virtual switching
   because of their in-network location and high packet processing rate. Recent
   advances in programmable switch ASICs open more opportunities for offloading
   various functionality to switches. However, the limited memory capacity on
   switches has been a major challenge that such applications struggle to deal
   with. In this paper, we envision that by enabling network switches to access
   remote memory purely from data planes, the performance of a wide range of
   applications can be improved. We design three remote memory primitives,
   leveraging RDMA operations, and show the feasibility of accessing remote
   memory from switches using our prototype implementation.

   Storage systems in data centers are an important component of large-scale
   online services. They typically perform replicated transactional operations
   for high data availability and integrity. Today, however, such operations
   suffer from high tail latency even with recent kernel bypass and storage
   optimizations, and thus affect the predictability of end-to-end performance
   of these services. We observe that the root cause of the problem is the
   involvement of the CPU, a precious commodity in multi-tenant settings, in the
   critical path of replicated transactions. In this paper, we present
   HyperLoop, a new framework that removes CPU from the critical path of
   replicated transactions in storage systems by offloading them to commodity
   RDMA NICs, with non-volatile memory as the storage medium. To achieve this,
   we develop new and general NIC offloading primitives that can perform memory
   operations on all nodes in a replication group while guaranteeing ACID
   properties without CPU involvement. We demonstrate that popular storage
   applications can be easily optimized using our primitives. Our evaluation
   results with microbenchmarks and application benchmarks show that HyperLoop
   can reduce 99th percentile latency ≈800x with close to
   0% CPU consumption on replicas.

  Traffic redundancy elimination (RE) is an attractive approach to improve the
  throughput in bandwidth-limited networks. While previous studies show that the
  RE is useful for improving the throughput in such networks, we observed that
  the RE would not be an effective solution in wireless networks. We found the
  TCP congestion control cannot take advantage of the RE, without knowing how
  the underlying RE system manipulates each TCP packet. In this letter, we
  present a novel technique called REboost to enable the TCP layer to be aware
  of the underlying RE system and improve the throughput. Our evaluation with a
  prototype shows that REboost significantly improves the throughput compared
  with the previous RE systems.

  We analyze the software stack of popular mobile advertising libraries on
  Android and investigate how they protect the users of advertising-supported
  apps from malicious advertising. We find that, by and large, Android
  advertising libraries properly separate the privileges of the ads from the
  host app by confining ads to dedicated browser instances that correctly apply
  the same origin policy.
  
  We then demonstrate how malicious ads can infer sensitive information about
  users by accessing external storage, which is essential for media-rich ads in
  order to cache video and images. Even though the same origin policy prevents
  confined ads from reading other apps’ external-storage files, it does not
  prevent them from learning that a file with a particular name exists. We show
  how, depending on the app, the mere existence of a file can reveal sensitive
  information about the user. For example, if the user has a pharmacy
  price-comparison app installed on the device, the presence of external-storage
  files with certain names reveals which drugs the user has looked for.
  
  We conclude with our recommendations for redesigning mobile advertising
  software to better protect users from malicious advertising.

  Mobile applications are increasingly integrating third-party libraries to
  provide various features, such as advertising, analytics, social networking,
  and more. Unfortunately, such integration with third-party libraries comes
  with the cost of potential privacy violations of users, because Android always
  grants a full set of permissions to third-party libraries as their host
  applications. Unintended accesses to users’ private data are underestimated
  threats to users’ privacy, as complex and often obfuscated third-party
  libraries make it hard for application developers to estimate the correct
  behaviors of third-party libraries. More critically, a wide adoption of native
  code (JNI) and dynamic code executions such as Java reflection or dynamic code
  reloading, makes it even harder to apply state-of-the-art security analysis. In
  this work, we propose FLEXDROID, a new Android security model and isolation
  mechanism, that provides dynamic, fine-grained access control for third-party
  libraries. With FLEXDROID, application developers not only can gain a full
  control of third-party libraries (e.g., which permissions to grant or not),
  but also can specify how to make them behave after detecting a privacy
  violation (e.g., providing a mock user’s information or kill). To achieve such
  goals, we define a new notion of principals for third-party libraries, and
  develop a novel security mechanism, called inter-process stack inspection that
  is effective to JNI as well as dynamic code execution. Our usability study
  shows that developers can easily adopt FLEXDROID’s policy to their existing
  applications. Finally, our evaluation shows that FLEXDROID can effectively
  restrict the permissions of third-party libraries with negligible overheads.

  A variety of advantages from sounds such as measurement and accessibility
  introduces a new opportunity for mobile applications to offer broad types of
  interesting, valuable functionalities, supporting a richer user experience.
  However, in spite of the growing interests on mobile sound applications, few
  or no works have been done in focusing on managing an audio device
  effectively. More specifically, their low level of real-time capability for
  audio resources makes it challenging to satisfy tight timing requirements of
  mobile sound applications, e.g., a high sensing rate of acoustic sensing
  applications. To address this problem, this work presents the SounDroid
  framework, an audio device management framework for real-time audio requests
  from mobile sound applications. The design of SounDroid is based on the
  requirement analysis of audio requests as well as an understanding of the
  audio playback procedure including the audio request scheduling and
  dispatching on Android. It then incorporates both real-time audio request
  scheduling algorithms, called EDF-V and AFDS, and dispatching optimization
  techniques into mobile platforms, and thus improves the quality-of-service of
  mobile sound applications. Our experimental results with the prototype
  implementation of SounDroid demonstrate that it is able to enhance scheduling
  performance for audio requests, compared to traditional mechanisms (by up to
  40% of improvement), while allowing deterministic dispatching latency.</p>

  Wireless video traffic has grown at an unprecedented rate and put significant
  burden on wireless networks. Multicast can significantly reduce traffic by
  sending a single video to multiple receivers simultaneously. On the other
  hand, wireless receivers are heterogeneous due to both channel and antenna
  heterogeneity, the latter of which is rapidly increasing with the emergence of
  802.11n and 802.11ac. In this paper, we develop optimized layered integrated
  video encoding (LIVE) to guarantee reasonable performance to weaker receivers
  (with worse channel and/or fewer antennas) and allow stronger receivers to
  enjoy better quality. Our approach has three distinct features: (i) It uses a
  novel layered coding to naturally accommodate the heterogeneity of different
  video receivers; (ii) It uses an optimization framework to optimize the amount
  of time used for transmission and the amount of information to transmit at
  each layer under the current channel condition; and (iii) It uses an
  integrated modulation, where most video data are transmitted using soft
  modulation to enjoy efficiency and resilience while the most important video
  data are transmitted using a combination of soft modulation and conventional
  hard modulation to further enhance their reliability. To our knowledge, this
  is the first approach that handles MIMO antenna heterogeneity in wireless
  video multicast. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive Matlab
  simulation and USRP testbed experiments.</p>

  Hardware-based external monitors have been proposed as a trustworthy method
  for protecting the kernel integrity. We introduce the design and
  implementation of Address Translation Redirection Attack (ATRA) that enables
  complete evasion of the hardware-based external monitor that anchors its trust
  on a separate processor. ATRA circumvents the external monitor by redirecting
  the memory access to critical kernel objects into a non-monitored region.
  Despite the seriousness of the ATRA issue, the address translation integrity
  has been assumed in many hardware-based external monitors and the possibility
  of its exploitation has been suggested yet many considered hypothetical. We
  explore the intricate details of ATRA, explain major challenges in realizing
  ATRA in practice, and address them with two types of ATRA called Memory-bound
  ATRA and Register-bound ATRA. Our evaluations with benchmarks show that ATRA
  does not introduce a noticeable performance degradation to the host system,
  proving practical applicability of the attack to alert the researchers to
  seriously address ATRA in designing future external monitors.</p>

      <p>Explosive growth of WiFi traffic calls for new technologies to
  dramatically improve spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we propose an
  approach to adapt the spectrum on a per-frame basis. It consists of three
  major components: (i) a fine-grained spectrum access design that allows a
  sender and receiver to change their transmission and reception spectrum on
  demand, (ii) fast and accurate spectrum detection that allows a receiver to
  determine which spectrum is used by its sender on a per-frame basis by
  exploiting the IEEE 802.11 preamble structure, and (iii) an efficient spectrum
  allocation algorithm that determines which spectrum to use for each
  transmission by taking into account frequency diversity and interference. It
  can further be adapted to perform a joint assignment of spectrum, schedule,
  and access point (AP) for each frame. Using a SORA implementation and
  trace-driven simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of per-frame spectrum
  adaptation and its significant benefit over existing channel assignment
  approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first per-frame spectrum adaptation
  prototype for WiFi networks.</p>

      <p>Recently, wireless communication methods that exploit the broadcast
  nature of the wireless medium have been attracting growing attention. Among
  these methods, opportunistic routing and network coding are regarded as the
  most promising techniques. While there have been some attempts to combine
  opportunistic routing with network coding to capture the advantages of both
  techniques, none of these attempts has considered bit-rate selection for data
  transmission in multi-rate wireless networks. In this paper, we study the
  potential benefits of the combination of opportunistic routing and network
  coding with the bit-rate selection mechanism from an optimization perspective.
  We develop a theoretical model and algorithm for finding the optimal
  forwarding scheme for a multi-rate combination of opportunistic routing and
  network coding in a given network. MIT Roofnet trace-based simulations show
  that considering bit-rate selection in combination with opportunistic routing
  and network coding has substantial benefits in terms of the expected
  transmission time compared to multi-rate opportunistic routing, multi-rate
  network coding, and a fixed-rate combination approach.</p>

      <p>Recently, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) has received much attention as
  a mobility management protocol in next-generation all-IP mobile networks.
  While the current research related to PMIPv6 mainly focuses on providing
  efficient handovers for unicast-based applications, there has been relatively
  little interest in supporting multicast services with PMIPv6. To provide
  support for multicast services with PMIPv6, there are two alternative
  approaches called Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)-based subscription and Local
  Mobility Anchor (LMA)-based subscription. However, MAG-based subscription
  causes a large overhead for multicast joining and LMA-based subscription
  provides non-optimal multicast routing paths. The two approaches may also
  cause a high packet loss rate. In this paper, we propose an efficient
  PMIPv6-based multicast protocol that aims to provide an optimal delivery path
  for multicast data and to reduce handover delay and packet loss rate. Through
  simulation studies, we found that the proposed protocol outperforms existing
  multicast solutions for PMIPv6 in terms of end-to-end delay, service
  disruption period, and the number of lost packets during handovers.</p>
