I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the <a href="https://cs.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>. Prior to joining UT Austin, I was a Senior Researcher in the <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-for-operators-afo-research/"> Office of the CTO in the Azure for Operators group</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/">Microsoft Research Redmond</a>.


My research interests lie at the intersection of systems and networking, with a focus on building software systems that improve the performance, efficiency, and resilience of data- and network-intensive applications running on emerging programmable infrastructures (e.g., programmable switches, NICs, and xPUs). I have also worked on various topics in security and wireless systems.

I received my PhD in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by 
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/">Vyas Sekar</a>
and
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/">Srinivasan Seshan</a>. My <a href="assets/papers/cmu-phd-thesis.pdf">PhD thesis</a> introduced new abstractions and runtime systems to enable resilient and elastic in-network computing. My work was in part supported by 
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!fellows">Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship</a>.
Prior to joining CMU, I worked at KAIST as a research scientist. 
Before then, I completed a BS and MS degrees in
Computer Science and Engineering from POSTECH, South Korea.
