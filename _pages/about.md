I am an assistant professor of computer science at the <a href="https://cs.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>. I co-lead the <a href="https://utns.cs.utexas.edu">UT Networked Systems Research Group</a> and  am also a member of the <a href="https://wncg.org/">Wireless Networking and Communications Group</a> and <a href="http://6g-ut.org/">6G@UT</a>. 

My research focuses on networked systems, distributed systems, and operating systems. I build new hardware and software systems that make cloud and edge datacenters faster, more efficient, and more resilient.


Prior to joining UT Austin, I was a senior researcher in the <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-for-operators-afo-research/"> Office of the CTO in the Azure for Operators group</a> and at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/">Microsoft Research Redmond</a>.
I received my PhD from the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by 
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/">Vyas Sekar</a>
and
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/">Srinivasan Seshan</a>. My <a href="assets/papers/cmu-phd-thesis.pdf">dissertation</a> introduced new abstractions and runtime systems to enable elastic and resilient in-network computing. My work was supported in part by the 
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!fellows">Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship</a>.
Prior to joining CMU, I worked as a research scientist at KAIST. 
Before that, I received a BS and MS degrees in
Computer Science and Engineering from POSTECH, South Korea.
