I am a senior researcher at Microsoft in the <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-for-operators-afo-research/"> Office of CTO at Azure for Operators</a>.
I completed my PhD in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by 
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/">Vyas Sekar</a>
and
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/">Srinivasan Seshan</a>.
Prior to CMU, I worked at KAIST as a research scientist. 
Before then, I received a BS and MS degree in
Computer Science and Engineering from POSTECH, South Korea.

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer systems and networking
with a focus on in-network computing. Recently, I have been
designing new abstractions and runtime systems for heterogeneous programmable
data plane devices such as network switches and NICs to enable elastic and resilient in-network computing.
In the past, I worked on various topics in systems security and wireless networks.

I am a recipient of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!fellows">2019 Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship</a>.
