I am a fifth-year PhD student in the <a
href="https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> at <a
href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I have the great fortune of being 
advised by 
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/">Vyas Sekar</a>
and
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/">Srinivasan Seshan</a>.
I am also a senior researcher at 
<a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-for-operators-afo-research/">Microsoft</a>.

Prior to CMU, I worked at <a href="http://www.kaist.edu">KAIST</a> for three
years as a research scientist.  Before then, I received a BS and MS degree in
Computer Science and Engineering from <a
href="http://www.postech.edu">POSTECH</a>, South Korea.

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer systems and networking
with a recent focus on in-network computing.  Recently, I have been
designing new abstractions and runtime systems for heterogeneous programmable
data plane devices such as network switches and NICs to enable elastic and resilient in-network computing.
In the past, I worked on various topics in systems security and wireless networks.

I am a recipient of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!fellows">2019 Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship</a>.
