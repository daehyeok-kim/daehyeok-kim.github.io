I am an incoming assistant professor of computer science at the <a href="https://cs.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>, and I am currently a senior researcher at Microsoft in the <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-for-operators-afo-research/"> Office of CTO at Azure for Operators group</a>.

My research interests lie in the intersection of systems and networking
with a focus on building software systems that improve the performance, efficiency, and resiliency of data- and network-intensive applications running on emerging programmable infrastructure (e.g., programmable switches, NICs, and xPUs). 
I also worked on various topics in systems security and wireless systems.

I completed my PhD in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by 
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/">Vyas Sekar</a>
and
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/">Srinivasan Seshan</a>. My work was supported by 
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!fellows">Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship</a>.
Prior to CMU, I worked at KAIST as a research scientist. 
Before then, I received a BS and MS degree in
Computer Science and Engineering from POSTECH, South Korea.
