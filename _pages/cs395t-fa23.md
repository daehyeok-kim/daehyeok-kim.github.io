**Course overview:**

This is a graduate-level course in computer networks. In this course, we will explore both classic and recent topics in computer networks. The goals for this course are:

* To understand the history of computer networking, state-of-the-art network protocols at different layers, network architectures, and networked systems. 

* To critically review research papers in computer networks and networked systems.

* To explore research problems and investigate novel ideas through a semester-long research project.

The course will be structured around lectures by the instructor and paper reading/presentations by the students with open discussions. 
Students will form a project group (1--2 students) and conduct a research project on networking and networked systems.
