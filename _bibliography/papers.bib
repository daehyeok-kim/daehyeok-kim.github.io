   Programmable switches have been touted as an attractive alternative for
   deploying network functions (NFs) such as network address translators (NATs),
   load balancers, and firewalls. However, their limited memory capacity has
   been a major stumbling block that has stymied their adoption for supporting
   state-intensive NFs such as cloud-scale NATs and load balancers that maintain
   millions of flow-table entries. In this paper, we explore a new approach that
   leverages DRAM on servers available in typical NFV clusters. Our new system
   architecture, called TEA (Table Extension Architecture), provides a virtual
   table abstraction that allows NFs on programmable switches to look up large
   virtual tables built on external DRAM. Our approach enables switch ASICs to
   access external DRAM purely in the data plane without involving CPUs on
   servers. We address key design and implementation challenges in realizing
   this idea. We demonstrate its feasibility and practicality with our
   implementation on a Tofino-based programmable switch. Our evaluation shows
   that NFs built with TEA can look up table entries on external DRAM with low
   and predictable latency (1.8-2.2 $\mu s$) and the lookup throughput can be
   linearly scaled with additional servers (138 million lookups per seconds with
   8 servers).

   Reconfigurable datacenter networks (RDCNs) augment traditional packet
   switches with high-bandwidth reconfigurable circuits. In these networks,
   high-bandwidth circuits are assigned to particular source-destination rack
   pairs based on a schedule. To make efficient use of RDCNs, active TCP flows
   between such pairs must quickly ramp up their sending rates when
   high-bandwidth circuits are made available. Past studies have shown that TCP
   performs well on RDCNs with millisecond-scale reconfiguration delays, during
   which time the circuit network is offline. However, modern RDCNs can
   reconfigure in as little as 20 $\mu s$, and maintain a particular
   configuration for fewer than 10 RTTs. We show that existing TCP variants
   cannot ramp up quickly enough to work well on these modern RDCNs. We identify
   two methods to address this issue: First, an in-network solution that
   dynamically resizes top-of-rack switch virtual output queues to prebuffer
   packets; Second, an endpoint-based solution that increases the congestion
   window, cwnd, based on explicit circuit state feedback sent via the ECN-echo
   bit. To evaluate these techniques, we build an open-source RDCN emulator,
   Etalon, and show that a combination of dynamic queue resizing and explicit
   circuit state feedback increases circuit utilization by 1.91x with an
   only 1.20x increase in tail latency.

   Many popular large-scale cloud applications are increasingly using
   containerization for high resource efficiency and lightweight isolation. In
   parallel, many data-intensive applications (e.g., data analytics and deep
   learning frameworks) are adopting or looking to adopt RDMA for high
   networking performance. Industry trends suggest that these two approaches are
   on an inevitable collision course. In this paper, we present FreeFlow, a
   software-based RDMA virtualization framework designed for containerized
   clouds. FreeFlow realizes virtual RDMA networking purely with a
   software-based approach using commodity RDMA NICs. Unlike existing RDMA
   virtualization solutions, FreeFlow fully satisfies the requirements from
   cloud environments, such as isolation for multi-tenancy, portability for
   container migrations, and controllability for control and data plane
   policies. FreeFlow is also transparent to applications and provides
   networking performance close to bare-metal RDMA with low CPU overhead. In our
   evaluations with TensorFlow and Spark, FreeFlow provides almost the same
   application performance as bare-metal RDMA.

   Storage systems in data centers are an important component of large-scale
   online services. They typically perform replicated transactional operations
   for high data availability and integrity. Today, however, such operations
   suffer from high tail latency even with recent kernel bypass and storage
   optimizations, and thus affect the predictability of end-to-end performance
   of these services. We observe that the root cause of the problem is the
   involvement of the CPU, a precious commodity in multi-tenant settings, in the
   critical path of replicated transactions. In this paper, we present
   HyperLoop, a new framework that removes CPU from the critical path of
   replicated transactions in storage systems by offloading them to commodity
   RDMA NICs, with non-volatile memory as the storage medium. To achieve this,
   we develop new and general NIC offloading primitives that can perform memory
   operations on all nodes in a replication group while guaranteeing ACID
   properties without CPU involvement. We demonstrate that popular storage
   applications can be easily optimized using our primitives. Our evaluation
   results with microbenchmarks and application benchmarks show that HyperLoop
   can reduce 99th percentile latency \approx 800x with close to
   0% CPU consumption on replicas.

  We analyze the software stack of popular mobile advertising libraries on
  Android and investigate how they protect the users of advertising-supported
  apps from malicious advertising. We find that, by and large, Android
  advertising libraries properly separate the privileges of the ads from the
  host app by confining ads to dedicated browser instances that correctly apply
  the same origin policy.
  
  We then demonstrate how malicious ads can infer sensitive information about
  users by accessing external storage, which is essential for media-rich ads in
  order to cache video and images. Even though the same origin policy prevents
  confined ads from reading other appsâ€™ external-storage files, it does not
  prevent them from learning that a file with a particular name exists. We show
  how, depending on the app, the mere existence of a file can reveal sensitive
  information about the user. For example, if the user has a pharmacy
  price-comparison app installed on the device, the presence of external-storage
  files with certain names reveals which drugs the user has looked for.
  
  We conclude with our recommendations for redesigning mobile advertising
  software to better protect users from malicious advertising.

  abstract={
  Mobile applications are increasingly integrating third-party libraries to
  provide various features, such as advertising, analytics, social networking,
  and more. Unfortunately, such integration with third-party libraries comes
  with the cost of potential privacy violations of users, because Android always
  grants a full set of permissions to third-party libraries as their host
  applications. Unintended accesses to usersâ€™ private data are underestimated
  threats to usersâ€™ privacy, as complex and often obfuscated third-party
  libraries make it hard for application developers to estimate the correct
  behaviors of third-party libraries. More critically, a wide adoption of native
  code (JNI) and dynamic code executions such as Java reflection or dynamic code
  reloading, makes it even harder to apply state-of-the-art security analysis. In
  this work, we propose FLEXDROID, a new Android security model and isolation
  mechanism, that provides dynamic, fine-grained access control for third-party
  libraries. With FLEXDROID, application developers not only can gain a full
  control of third-party libraries (e.g., which permissions to grant or not),
  but also can specify how to make them behave after detecting a privacy
  violation (e.g., providing a mock userâ€™s information or kill). To achieve such
  goals, we define a new notion of principals for third-party libraries, and
  develop a novel security mechanism, called inter-process stack inspection that
  is effective to JNI as well as dynamic code execution. Our usability study
  shows that developers can easily adopt FLEXDROIDâ€™s policy to their existing
  applications. Finally, our evaluation shows that FLEXDROID can effectively
  restrict the permissions of third-party libraries with negligible overheads.

  A variety of advantages from sounds such as measurement and accessibility

  However, in spite of the growing interests on mobile sound applications, few

  effectively. More specifically, their low level of real-time capability for
  audio resources makes it challenging to satisfy tight timing requirements of
  mobile sound applications, e.g., a high sensing rate of acoustic sensing
  applications. To address this problem, this work presents the SounDroid
  framework, an audio device management framework for real-time audio requests

  requirement analysis of audio requests as well as an understanding of the
  audio playback procedure including the audio request scheduling and
  dispatching on Android. It then incorporates both real-time audio request
  scheduling algorithms, called EDF-V and AFDS, and dispatching optimization
  techniques into mobile platforms, and thus improves the quality-of-service of
  mobile sound applications. Our experimental results with the prototype

  Wireless video traffic has grown at an unprecedented rate and put significant
  burden on wireless networks. Multicast can significantly reduce traffic by
  sending a single video to multiple receivers simultaneously. On the other
  hand, wireless receivers are heterogeneous due to both channel and antenna
  heterogeneity, the latter of which is rapidly increasing with the emergence of
  802.11n and 802.11ac. In this paper, we develop optimized layered integrated
  video encoding (LIVE) to guarantee reasonable performance to weaker receivers
  (with worse channel and/or fewer antennas) and allow stronger receivers to
  enjoy better quality. Our approach has three distinct features: (i) It uses a
  novel layered coding to naturally accommodate the heterogeneity of different
  video receivers; (ii) It uses an optimization framework to optimize the amount
  of time used for transmission and the amount of information to transmit at
  each layer under the current channel condition; and (iii) It uses an
  integrated modulation, where most video data are transmitted using soft
  modulation to enjoy efficiency and resilience while the most important video
  data are transmitted using a combination of soft modulation and conventional
  hard modulation to further enhance their reliability. To our knowledge, this
  is the first approach that handles MIMO antenna heterogeneity in wireless
  video multicast. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive Matlab

  a mobility management protocol in next-generation all-IP mobile networks.
  While the current research related to PMIPv6 mainly focuses on providing
  efficient handovers for unicast-based applications, there has been relatively
  little interest in supporting multicast services with PMIPv6. To provide
  support for multicast services with PMIPv6, there are two alternative
  approaches called Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)-based subscription and Local
  Mobility Anchor (LMA)-based subscription. However, MAG-based subscription
  causes a large overhead for multicast joining and LMA-based subscription
  provides non-optimal multicast routing paths. The two approaches may also
  cause a high packet loss rate. In this paper, we propose an efficient
  PMIPv6-based multicast protocol that aims to provide an optimal delivery path
  for multicast data and to reduce handover delay and packet loss rate. Through
